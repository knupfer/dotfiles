Obtaining
---------

The current version of the auto-overlays package can be obtained from:

  http://www.dr-qubit.org/emacs.php

Developed and maintained by Toby Cubitt (toby-predictive@dr-qubit.org).




Installing
----------

To install the package, extract the files using

  tar -xvzf auto-overlays.tar.gz

This will unpack the files into a new directory called
auto-overlays/. Now byte-compile all the Lisp files and create the
required dictionaries by running

  make

in the auto-overlays/ directory. If necessary, you can specify explicitly
where your Emacs resides with

  make EMACS=/path/to/emacs

Alternatively, if you cannot use the "make" utility, you can byte-compile
the Lisp files manually from within Emacs using `byte-compile-file' or
one of the other Emacs byte-compilation commands (see The Compilation
Functions, GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual). Personally, I like to use
`dired' when byte-compiling multiple files from within Emacs. (See
Operating on Files, GNU Emacs manual.)

Now copy the package files to a directory in your Emacs `load-path'
(you can view the current `load-path' from within Emacs using
"C-h v load-path").

The auto-overlays package is an Elisp library for use in other
packages. It doesn't provide any interactive commands or other user-level
features. See the included Auto Overlays Manual for details on how to use
it.
